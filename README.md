# Shopify Snippets

Welcome to my growing collection of Shopify code snippets, examples, and functional implementations!

This repository serves as a personal archive of Shopify-related code that I have written and found valuable across various projects. Whether it’s Liquid logic, JavaScript enhancements, Shopify API integrations, or performance optimizations, these snippets are designed to be both practical references and inspirational starting points for developers working with Shopify themes and custom functionality.

### What You’ll Find Here

This collection is continually evolving as I refine existing code and develop new solutions. If you find something useful, feel free to explore, adapt, and implement these snippets in your own projects!
